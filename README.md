Here we provide with all necessary files to enrole "KyotoUx-009x: Stochastic Processes: Data Analysis and Computer Simulation".

Contents (files will be uploaded week by week)
- 01: files for Week 1
- 02: files for Week 2
- 03: files for Week 3
- 04: files for Week 4
- 05: files for Week 5

How to follow each lesson

Download all files (must do for each week) 
- The top page of this giuhub -> "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP" -> Extract the downloaded zip in your local working directory to create all necessary files for that week. Be careful of overwriting the files used in previous weeks.

Method 1 (easier)
- You can start the downloaded jupyter notebooks in your web browser by simply typing the following command, where #1 and #2 represent the week and part numbers you are following.

        jupyter notebook 009x_#1#2.ipynb

- Then watch the corresponding video.

Method 2 (harder but more useful to learn programming)
- You can start a new blank jupyter notebook by typing the following command before watching each video.
  
        jupyter notebook

- Refer to one of the Notebooks provided via nbviewer and github while watching the video. You can find the links to the Notebooks under each video.
- Then you can type the code and commands (or copy and paste from the Notebook to the corresponding cells) directly in the blank jupyter notebook to reproduce the code presented in class.
  
Let's enjoy the course!
